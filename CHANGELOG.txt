RELEASE 2.1.1 - 2009-09-18

- Bugfix: TimerThread is now spawned as a daemon, if the scheduler has
  been set to act as a daemon with the setDaemon(true) method.
- The step values parser has been changed to be more compliant with the
  majority of the cron implementations. Now "a-b/c" means "took a value
  every c elements in the range a-b", and no more "took every element
  within the a-b range whose value can be divided by c". In example
  "2-12/5" means now "2,7,12", while before it was "5,10".
